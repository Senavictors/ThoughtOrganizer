My name is Victor, I'm 22 years old, I currently work as technical support at an IoT chip and equipment company, but my main goal is to become a fullstack developer.

I am following a new learning path, more focused and organized, so that I can achieve my goals.

With that, I decided to combine the useful with the pleasant and create a goal manager.

This way, I can learn more about programming and also better organize my goals.

This project started on January 25th and over the next few days I will be looking for improvements to it.
